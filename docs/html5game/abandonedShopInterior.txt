The shop smells terribly of rotten food, too far gone even for your strong stomach. The owners were one of the last to die, hoarding their produce until the end.

You take another sniff of the fetid air. Yes, he died right here. You can't see them, but you can definitely smell his dessicated remains.

There is a counter in front of you, and  rows of shelves to your left. As horrible as this place is, there may still be something useful here.
