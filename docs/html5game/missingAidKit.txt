You found him! Me is lying against a wall near the foot of the stairs, bleeding weakly from a head wound. He must have fallen down the stairs.

As you approach and gently nuzzle at him he groans and reaches a hand out to your ruff.

You feel an immense urge to stay with him and comfort him, but you're his only hope. There's got to be a way you can fix him.
