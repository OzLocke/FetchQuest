With the sun so low, it's already dark in the woods, but your eyes adjust easily. You can see small animals flitting about, and smell leaves and loam.

You can understand why some dogs prefer to go stray, something about the woods calls to you. But you know you'll always need people.

You could venture out into the woods, there could be something useful there. On the other hand, the stray dog's den is nearby, and you can see something shiny by the entrance.
