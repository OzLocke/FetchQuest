A window is open upstairs, but there's no way to reach it. There's only one other way into the house; a doggy door! 

You nudge it with your snoot but it seems to be locked. Maybe you need something to open it?

There's an image on the flap that you recognize: it looks like a bone. You've seen it on a collar a local stray dog has, she carries it wherever she goes.
