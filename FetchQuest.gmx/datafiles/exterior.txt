You shrug your way into your backpack, before leaping out the window.

The sun's getting low, Me really has been gone way too long. The wind is picking up, it's cold and it brings even worse smells with it.

To your left you can see the path that leads into the woods, where a stray dog lives in a small den. Opposite you is the old grocery store, and an abandoned house, and to your right you can see the old woman that shares the cu-de-sac with you, tending to her yard.
