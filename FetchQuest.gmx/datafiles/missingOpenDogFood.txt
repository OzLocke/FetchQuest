It looks like a collar, and you know you need it, but as you approach the stray intercepts you. 

She's filthy and rife with fleas, but she's still strong. You lie down, looking aside, letting her know you're safe. She relaxes, but growls as you rise to go over to the collar.

You try to show her that you need it. She seems to understand, but she wants something from you first. She nods her head towards her den before trotting off towards it.
